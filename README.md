**Analyzing Flight Delays with PySpark**

This project focuses on utilizing PySpark for the analysis of flight delay data. By leveraging PySpark's powerful capabilities, the project aims to provide insights into flight delays using a dataset sourced from Databricks. 

The workflow begins with loading the dataset, which is stored in CSV format, into a PySpark dataframe. Various operations are then performed on the dataframe to understand and manipulate the data. Initial steps include inspecting the schema, displaying a sample of the data, and calculating basic statistics like the total number of records.

Subsequent sections delve into analyzing the dataframe further. This involves tasks such as identifying the maximum flight delay, filtering the data based on delay criteria, sorting the dataframe, and generating descriptive statistics. Additionally, the project demonstrates techniques for handling missing values, including identifying and filling null values, as well as dropping rows with missing data.

With its clear and concise code examples, this project serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring flight delay data using PySpark. Whether for educational purposes, exploratory analysis, or as a foundation for more advanced analytics, this repository provides a solid starting point for working with large-scale datasets in PySpark.
